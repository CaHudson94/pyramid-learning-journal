     '''Today is a first day, and like every first day of something it \
is TERRIFYING. I am having plenty of impostor feelings I am sure everyone \
in class is (or I am telling my self to keep calmer) with an added layer \
off feeling like I didn't do what I should have to get here. Being one of \
two new people to a group is a daunting feeling and I am terrible at \
ice breakers especially when I feel like an outsider to a group. The code \
and information was all fairly straight forward and I felt nicely \
comfortable when we got to touching on python. We will see what \
happens with classmates and each day of new information. \

and working with my group for the assignment today was good for getting \
into the swing and learning what needs some work on how things will flow \

in the class better but that will come with time.'''},

at a time if you can't figure out how to fix something with it or address \
an edge case. I also got to spend some great time getting to know more of \
the class a bit better and helping both my self and them learn and understand \
some of the work for today. All in all a productive, \
positive, and long day.'''},

started feeling a little comfortable with the learning and where I am at. \
This in no way means today was easy or easier on the contrary I probably \
spent more time working through code today than any day so far. I think with \
the coming days and next week I will really get my feet under me so I can \
gear into the sprinting and running ahead of us. Meeting more of the class \
has been somewhat slow going but I am getting there, I now hope to meet \
and maybe even make friends with everyone by at least week 8 if not \
sooner.'''},

working with new people but am a little worried about scheduling and \
balance everything as well as rounding out the things that needed fixing \
from the past work. Other than that we learned plenty about servers and \
classes today, I knew about classes before bu am apparently a lot worse \
and or rustier with them than I thought. Over all a long day but a good \
step into the week.'''},

better grasp of most of the concepts. Learned a lot more about inheritance \
vs. composition and how to properly use it (surprisingly simpler than my \
brain made it out to be). Working with my groups is a pleasure and Morgan \

but realistically I don't feel like it is possible to manage both going to \
these events and having all of the assignments done and well executed in \
the time that we have. I need sleep after all (wouldn't it be nice if we \
didn't though?) and so I feel like I should go to them but I am more pressed \
and concerned with finishing the work at hand. Learned about big O notation \
in class and had a fun little gist, sadly it was a reminder that I am \
apparently a very slow worker still. All things considered it was a \
productive and informative day while also being fairly hard.'''},

assignments that were given today. Both of my groups are finished up \
to the point of the previous day but it still means there is a lot to \
do before Monday and what was added today looks rather daunting on the \
server side. I really enjoyed the amount we dove into the server \
interactions in class but am also kind of sad it ate away at time for what \
had been planned but such is life.'''},

need to be better about that in the future. Learning a good deal about \
using composition, but I would love some good opportunities to use \
inheritance as well. This week has been good, a lot of new information \
coming in but I feel like I am processing it fairly well. The server side \
stuff was definitely the harder half but been able to get through it.'''},

experience with html and CSS which is nice but even so it seems like we are \
on fairly even footing with the class in general. Learning more and what I \
have learned is growing less daunting even while what is coming in new is \
still hitting quite hard. Managing dead lines has been kind of weird today \
with the 3 day weekend and not being sure what assignments are due when.'''},

am working with it should be interesting we do have some indecision on exact \
execution and definitely need to meet up for a fair chunk of planning but \
once that is out of the way everything else should pick up a nice flow. \
Learning new bits about data structures and as we learn new ones the old \
ones seem easier and simpler solutions reveal themselves to them as we go \
even if the new ones seem overtly more and more complicated. The server side \
of things still seems and feels like the harder portion of things although \
it still mostly makes sense, I just suck at anything front end.'''},

content of a 5 day week but with one less day before everything for that \
week is done. I like having that time to process and this just feels like \
more pressure to perform. I felt pretty lost today as far as direction \

security is pretty cool as I have always enjoyed cryptography to \
a certain degree, math and all that, and it is a fairly simple and \
understandable way to secure data. I would be interested to learn \
more on how exactly the salt is used in the layering of the \
cryptogram. The concept of traversal seems fairly easy but being \
sick made it friarly hard to actually figure out how to do. I \
feel really sorry for my team mates and for missing class.'''},

REALLY been needing as it is the thing I am most in the dark and \
behind with. Hopefully I can catch up over the weekend on some of \
this testing stuff but today went about as well as I could have \
hoped with having been out sick. We also made some good head way \
with project R&D.'''},

visualization and our web app. It is functional on all platforms which \
is great but inaccurate, hopefully our next days work will help solve \
this (I have some ideas but nothing concrete as of yet). Working together \

I learned some interesting things in each, some of the material on Friday may \
have been less Pythonic but still cool. Brook was great and did a really \
nice job with the explanation of hash tables and the work through on the app \
felt good since I and a few others seemed to have a decent grasp on it at \
this point. I am dreading working on data structures though since as of yet \
I have written or navigated all but 14 lines of the code for this pairing \
AND tried on multiple occasions to communicate and organize with him while \
getting nothing back. Casey is a bit better but it seems both of my partners \
ghosted for baby week.'''}
