'''Today is a first day, and like every first day of something it \
is TERRIFYING. I am having plenty of impostor feelings I am sure everyone \
in class is (or I am telling my self to keep calmer) with an added layer \
off feeling like I didn't do what I should have to get here. Being one of \
two new people to a group is a daunting feeling and I am terrible at \
ice breakers especially when I feel like an outsider to a group. The code \
and information was all fairly straight forward and I felt nicely \
comfortable when we got to touching on python. We will see what \
happens with classmates and each day of new information. \

'''Todays class had some fun notes for things for best practice that I needed \
and working with my group for the assignment today was good for getting \
into the swing and learning what needs some work on how things will flow \
in the course. Still would love a chance to really get to know more people \
in the class better but that will come with time.'''},

'''Today I learned the true importance of stepping through your code one line \
at a time if you can't figure out how to fix something with it or address \
an edge case. I also got to spend some great time getting to know more of \
the class a bit better and helping both my self and them learn and understand \
some of the work for today. All in all a productive, \
positive, and long day.'''},

'''Today was an interesting day it was long and challenging but I finally \
started feeling a little comfortable with the learning and where I am at. \
This in no way means today was easy or easier on the contrary I probably \
spent more time working through code today than any day so far. I think with \
the coming days and next week I will really get my feet under me so I can \
gear into the sprinting and running ahead of us. Meeting more of the class \
has been somewhat slow going but I am getting there, I now hope to meet \
and maybe even make friends with everyone by at least week 8 if not \
sooner.'''},

time better as losing points sucks.'''},

'''We got our new groups today which was exciting I am looking forward to \
working with new people but am a little worried about scheduling and \
balance everything as well as rounding out the things that needed fixing \
from the past work. Other than that we learned plenty about servers and \
classes today, I knew about classes before bu am apparently a lot worse \
and or rustier with them than I thought. Over all a long day but a good \
step into the week.'''},

'''Today went well, work flow was fairly efficient and I felt like I had a \
better grasp of most of the concepts. Learned a lot more about inheritance \
vs. composition and how to properly use it (surprisingly simpler than my \
brain made it out to be). Working with my groups is a pleasure and Morgan \
and I had some fun moments.'''},

'''Day by day more and more events happen that people go to and say I should \
but realistically I don't feel like it is possible to manage both going to \
these events and having all of the assignments done and well executed in \
the time that we have. I need sleep after all (wouldn't it be nice if we \
didn't though?) and so I feel like I should go to them but I am more pressed \
and concerned with finishing the work at hand. Learned about big O notation \
in class and had a fun little gist, sadly it was a reminder that I am \
apparently a very slow worker still. All things considered it was a \
productive and informative day while also being fairly hard.'''},

'''Today was very productive while also still failing to start on the \
assignments that were given today. Both of my groups are finished up \
to the point of the previous day but it still means there is a lot to \
do before Monday and what was added today looks rather daunting on the \
server side. I really enjoyed the amount we dove into the server \
interactions in class but am also kind of sad it ate away at time for what \
had been planned but such is life.'''},

'''Well a little late on this one doing the Friday ones is a little odd and I \
need to be better about that in the future. Learning a good deal about \
using composition, but I would love some good opportunities to use \
inheritance as well. This week has been good, a lot of new information \
coming in but I feel like I am processing it fairly well. The server side \
stuff was definitely the harder half but been able to get through it.'''},

'''Working with Erik today was fun and informative he has much more experience \
with html and CSS which is nice but even so it seems like we are on fairly \
even footing with the class in general. Learning more and what I have learned \
is growing less daunting even while what is coming in new is still hitting \
quite hard. Managing dead lines has been kind of weird today with the 3 \
day weekend and not being sure what assignments are due when.'''},

'''We got our groups for project week today and I am pretty happy with who I \
am working with it should be interesting we do have some indecision on exact \
execution and definitely need to meet up for a fair chunk of planning but \
once that is out of the way everything else should pick up a nice flow. \
Learning new bits about data structures and as we learn new ones the old \
ones seem easier and simpler solutions reveal themselves to them as we go \
even if the new ones seem overtly more and more complicated. The server side \
of things still seems and feels like the harder portion of things although \
it still mostly makes sense, I just suck at anything front end.'''},

'''Today I learned that 4 day weeks suck they have all the madness and \
content of a 5 day week but with one less day before everything for that \
week is done. I like having that time to process and this just feels like \
more pressure to perform. I felt pretty lost today as far as direction \
although the material made sense it was just a weird day.'''},
